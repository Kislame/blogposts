# CSS Transitions

CSS transitions allow you to smoothly animate changes in CSS property values. With transitions, you can create more engaging and visually appealing user interfaces. This document provides an introduction to CSS transitions, how they work, and examples of how to use them.

## Introduction

CSS transitions provide a way to control the animation of property changes. They are particularly useful for creating smooth and gradual transitions between different states of an element, such as changing its color, size, or position. Transitions are triggered by changes in property values and can be applied to a wide range of CSS properties.

## Syntax

The basic syntax for defining a CSS transition is as follows:

```css
/* Property name, duration, timing function, delay */
transition: property duration timing-function delay;
```
